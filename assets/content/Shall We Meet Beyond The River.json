        "Shall we meet beyond the river.\nWhere the surges cease to roll?\nWhere, in all the bright forever,\nSorrow ne'er shall press the soul?",
        "Shall we meet in that blest harbor,\nWhen our stormy voyage is o'er?\nShall we meet and cast the anchor\nBy the fair, celestial shore?",
        "Shall we meet in yonder city,\nWhere the towers of crystal shine?\nWhere the walls are all of jasper,\nBuilt by workmanship divine?",
        "Shall we meet with Christ, our Savior,\nWhen He comes to claim His own?\nShall we know His blessed favour,\nAnd sit down upon His throne?"

    "chorus": "Shall we meet, shall we meet,\nShall we meet beyond the river?\nShall we meet beyond the river,\nWhere the surges cease to roll?"
