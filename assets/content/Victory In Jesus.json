        "I heard an old, old story,\nhow a Savior came from glory\n How He gave His life on Calvary\n to save a wretch like me\n I heard about His groaning,\n of His precious blood's atoning\n Then I repented of my sins,\n and won the victory, yeah",
        "I heard about His healing,\n of His cleansing power revealing\n How He made the lame to walk again\n and 'caused the blind to see\n And then I cried,  Dear Jesus,\n come and heal my broken spirit \n And somehow Jesus came\n and brought to me the victory",
        "Victory in Jesus,\n my Savior forever\n He sought me and He bought me\n with His redeeming blood\n He loved me 'ere I knew Him\n and all my love is due Him\n He plunged me to victory beneath\n the cleansing flood, oh yeah\n Sweet, sweet Jesus, mm Ooh  Mm",
        "Yes, victory in Jesus,\n my Savior forever\n He sought me and He bought me\n with His redeeming blood\n He loved me 'ere I knew Him\n and all my love is due Him\n He plunged me to victory beneath\n the cleansing flood\n Yes, he plunged me to victory\n beneath the cleansing flood"
