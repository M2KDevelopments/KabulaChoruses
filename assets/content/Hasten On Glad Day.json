    "chorus": "Hasten on, glad day, Bear the sheaves away\nHasten on, glad day, Bear the sheaves away\nBear us home.",
    "verses": [
        "The world's glorious harvest is fast drawing on,\nThe Master is calling his reapers to come;\nThe grain bright and golden, in fields far and near\nIs ripe for the garner when he shall appear.",
        "That morn everlasting, that day free from tears\nIs swiftly approaching as on roll the years!\nThe wheat, rudely scattered by sin's cruel blast,\nThen hasten to gather e'er autumn be past.",
        "O sweet is the labor that flows from love!\nA stream never failing, whose Fount is above;\n'Tis love that invites us, â€˜tis love points the field,\nTis love wields the sickle, and wondrous the yield."
