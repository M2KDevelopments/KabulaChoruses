    "chorus": "This is our God, the Servant King\nHe calls us now to follow Him;\nTo bring our lives as a daily offering\nOf worship to the Servant King.",
    "verses": [
        "From heav'n You came, helpless Babe,\nEnter'd our world, Your glory veiled;\nNot to be served, but to serve,\nAnd give Your life that we might live.",
        "There in the garden of tears,\nMy heavy load He chose to bear;\nHis heart with sorrow was torn,\n'Yet not my will, but Yours,' He said.",
        "Come, see His hands and His feet.\nThe scars that speak of sacrifice;\nHands that flung stars into space,\nTo cruel nails surrendered.",
        "So let us learn how to serve,\nAnd in our lives enthrone Him;\nEach other's needs to prefer,\nFor it is Christ we're serving."
