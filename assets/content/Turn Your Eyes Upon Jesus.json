{"number":290,"title":"290. Turn Your Eyes Upon Jesus","verses":["O soul, are you weary and troubled?\nNo light in the darkness you see?\nThere's light for a look at the Savior,\nAnd life more abundant and free!","Through death into life everlasting\nHe passed, and we follow Him there;\nOver us sin no more hath dominion,\nFor more than conqu'rors we are!","His word shall not fail you He promised;\nBelieve Him and all will be well:\nThen go to a world that is dying,\nHis perfect salvation to tell!"],"chorus":"Turn your eyes upon Jesus,\nLook full in His wonderful face;\nAnd the things of earth will grow strangely dim\nIn the light of His glory and grace."}
