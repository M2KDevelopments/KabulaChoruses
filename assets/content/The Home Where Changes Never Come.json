        "The home where changes ne-ver come,\nNor pain nor sor-row, toil nor care\nYes! ‘tis a bright and bless-ed home,\nWho would not fain be rest-ing there?",
        "Yet when bowed down beneath the load,\nBy Heaven allowed, thine earthly lot;\nThou yearnst to reach that blest a — bode,\nWait, meek-ly wait and mur-mur not.",
        "If in thy path some thorns are found,\nO think who bore them on his brow;\nIf grief thy sorrowing heart has found,\nIt reached a ho-li-er than thou.",
        "Toil on, nor deem though sore it be,\nOne sigh un-heard, one prayer for-got;\nThe day of rest will dawn for thee!\nWait, meek-ly wait and mur-mur not."
