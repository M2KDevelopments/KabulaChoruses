    "chorus": "All things bright and beautiful,\nAll creatures great and small; All things\nwise and wonderful, The Lord God\nmade them all.",
    "verses": [
        "Each little flower that opens,\nEach little bird that sings;\nHe made their glowing colors,\nHe made their tiny wings.",
        "The purple headed mountain,\nThe river running by,\nThe sunset and the morning\nThat brightens up the sky.",
        "The cold wind in the winter,\nThe pleasant summer sun,\nThe ripe fruit in the garden,\nHe made them every one.",
        "He gave us eyes to see them,\nAnd lips that we might tell\nHow great is God Almighty,\nWho has made all things well."
