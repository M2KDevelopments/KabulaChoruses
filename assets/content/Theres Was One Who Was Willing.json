    "verse": [
        "There was one who was will-ing\nto die in my stead, That a\na soul so un-woth-y might live,\nAnd the path to the cross\nHe was will-ing to tread,\nAll the sins of my life to for-give.",
        "He is ten-der and lov-ing and pa-tient with me,\nWhile He Cleane-es my heart of its dross,\nBut “there’s no Con-dem-na-tion;”\nI know I am free,\nfor my sins are nailed to the cross",
        "I will cling to my Sav-iour\nand nev-er de-part-I will\nJoy-ful-ly jour-ney each day,\nWith a song on my lips and\na Song in my heart,\nThat my sins have been tak-en a-way"
    ],
    "chorus": "They are nailed to the cross,\nThey are nailed to the cross,\nO how much He was will-ing to bear!\nWith what an-guish\nAnd loss, Je-sus went to the cross!\nBut He car-ried my Sins with Him there."
