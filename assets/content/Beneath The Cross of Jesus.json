        "Beneath the Cross of Jesus",
        "I fain would take my stand",
        "The show of a might Rock",
        "Within a weary land:",
        "A home within the wilderness",
        "A rest upon the way",
        "From the burning of",
        "the noontide heat",
        "And the burden of the day",
        "O safe and happy shelter",
        "O refuge tried and sweet",
        "O trysting place where heaven's love",
        "And heaven's justice meet!",
        "As to the homeless patriarch That",
        "wondrous dream was given",
        "So seems my Savior's cross to me",
        "A ladder up to heaven.",
        "There lies beneath its shadow, But on",
        "the farther side",
        "The darkness of an awful grave That",
        "gapes both deep and wide;",
        "And there between us stands the cross",
        "Two arms outstretched to save",
        "Like a watchman set to guard the way",
        "From that eternal grave."
