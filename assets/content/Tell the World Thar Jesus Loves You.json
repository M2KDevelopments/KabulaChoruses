        "Tell the world that Jesus loves you.\nTell them you found a forever friend;\nYou've opened up your heart's door to him,\nThe love of Jesus has no end!",
        "You can choose what not to believe in,\nYou can deny there's a heaven above;\nBut once you take a look at Jesus,\nThere's no denying that God is love."
