        "O Children, come quickly, O come, one and all!",
        "O come to the cradle in Bethlehem’s stall,",
        "And gaze on tHe wonder, the gift from above",
        "Our Father in heaven hath sent us with love.",
        "How datk is the stable, How dark is the night;",
        "Yet see how the manger is beaming with light.",
        "O gaze on the Babe in the crib where he lies,",
        "More fair than the angels that dwell in the skies.",
        "He lies in the manger, He dies in the hay,",
        "With Jeseph and Mary beside him to stay.",
        "The shepherds. are kneeling m rev’rence and prayer,",
        "While songs of the angels are fillimg the air."
