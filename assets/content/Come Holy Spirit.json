        "Come, Holy Spirit, heavenly Dove,\n With all Thy quickening powers;\n Kindle a flame of sacred love\n In these coll hearts of ours.\n",
        "O raise our thoughts from\nthings below,\nFrom vanities and toys!\nThen shall we with fresh\ncourage go\nTo reach eternal joys.",
        "Awake our souls to joyful songs;\nLet pure devotions rise;\nTill praise employs our thankful tongues,\nAnd doubt forever dies."
