        "He that goeth forth with weeping\nBearing precious seed in love\nNever tiring, never sleeping\nWill find mercy from above",
        "Soft descend the dews of heaven,\nBright the rays celestial shine;\nPrecious fruits will thus be given\nThro' an influence all divine.",
        "Sow thy seed, be never weary,\nLet no fears they soul annoy;\nBe the prospect very dreary,\nYou shalt reap the fruits of joy.",
        "Lo, the scene of verdure brightning!\nSee the rising grain appear;\nLook! the waving fields are whitning,\nFor the harvest time is near."
