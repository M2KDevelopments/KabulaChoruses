        "Satan’s like a roaring lion\nroaming to and fro; Seeking whom he may\ndevour, the Bible tells me so. Many souls have\nbeen his prey to fall in some weak hour,\nBut God has promised us today,\nHis overcoming power.",
        "On the day of Pentecost, a rushing mighty wind.\nBlew into the upper room, And baptized all of\nthem. With a Power greater than, any earthly foe,\nAnd I’m so glad I’ve got it, too, I’m gonna let the\nwhole world know."
