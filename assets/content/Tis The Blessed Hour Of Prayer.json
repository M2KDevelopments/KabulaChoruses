        "'Tis the blessed hour of prayer, when our hearts lowly bend,\nAnd we gather to Jesus, our Savior and Friend;\nIf we come to Him in faith, His protection to share,\nWhat a balm for the weary! O how sweet to be there!",
        "'Tis the blessed hour of prayer, when the Savior draws near,\nWith a tender compassion His children to hear;\nWhen He tells us we may cast at His feet every care,\nWhat a balm for the weary! O how sweet to be there!",
        "'Tis the blessed hour of prayer, when the tempted and tried\nTo the Savior who loves them their sorrows confide;\nWith a sympathizing heart He removes every care;\nWhat a balm for the weary! O how sweet to be there!",
        "At the blessed hour of prayer, trusting Him we believe,\nThat the blessings we're needing we'll surely receive;\nIn the fullness of this trust we shall lose every care;\nWhat a balm for the weary! O how sweet to be there!"
    ],
    "chorus": "Blessed hour of prayer,\nBlessed hour of prayer,\nWhat a balm for the weary!\nO how sweet to be there!"
