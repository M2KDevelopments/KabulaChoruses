    "chorus": "You, You are my wholeness.\nYou are my compieteness.\nMy soul, my thirsty soul, can\nRest in the depths of Your love.",
    "verses": [
        "In You I find forgiveness.\nYes, In You I find release.\nIt's a wonder You take all the blunders I make\nAnd so graciously offer me peace.",
        "In You I find true friendship.\nYes, your love is so free of demand.\nThough I must hurt You so,\nYou keep letting me go\nTo discover the person I am.",
        "Like a Father, You long to protect me.\nYet you know I must learn on my own.\nWell, I've made my own choice\nto follow Your voice\nGuiding me back to my home."
