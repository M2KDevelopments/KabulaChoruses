        "I am so glad that our Father in heaven\nTells of His love in the book He has given;\nWonderful things in the Bible I see;\nThis is the dearest, that Jesus loves me.",
        "Tho' I forget Him and wander away,\nStill He loves me wherever I stray;\nBack to His dear loving arms would I flee,\nWhen I remember that Jesus loves me.",
        "Oh, if there's only one song I can sing\nWhen in His beauty I see the great King\nThis shall my song in eternity be\nOh, what a wonder that Jesus loves me."

    "chorus": "I am so glad that Jesus loves me\nJesus loves me, Jesus loves me\nI am so glad that Jesus loves me\nJesus loves even me.",
