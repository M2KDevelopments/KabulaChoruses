    "verses": [
        "I, the Lord of sea and sky,\nI have heard my people cry.\nAll who dwell in dark and sin,\nmy hand will save.\nI, who made the stars of night,\nI will make their darkness bright.\nWho will bear my light to them?\nWhom shall I send?",
        "I, the Lord of snow and rain,\nI have borne my people's pain.\nI have wept for love of them.\nThey turn away.\nI will break their hearts of stone,\ngive them hearts for love alone.\nI will speak my Word to them.\nWhom shall I send?",
        "I, the Lord of wind and flame.\nI will tend the poor and lame.\nI will set a feast for them; my hand will save.\nFinest bread I will provide 'til their hearts be satisfied.\nI will give my life to them.\nWhom shall I send?"
