    "verses": [
        "On a hill far away stood an old rugged cross,\nThe emblem of suffering and shame,\nAnd I love that old cross where the dearest and best\nFor a world of lost sinners was slain.",
        "Oh, that old rugged cross, so despised by the world,\nHas a wondrous attraction for me,\nFor the dear Lamb of God left His glory above,\nTo bear it to dark Calvary.",
        "To the old rugged cross I will ever be true,\nIts shame and reproach gladly bear;\nThen He'll call me some day to my home far away,\nWhere His glory forever I'll share."
    ],
    "chorus": "So I'll cherish the old rugged cross,\nTill my trophies at last I lay down;\nI will cling to the old rugged cross,\nAnd exchange it some day for a crown."
