    "verse": [
        "Angry words! Oh, let them never\nFrom the tongue unbridled slip;\nMay the heart's best impulse ever\nCheck them eâ€™er they soil the lip",
        "Love is much too pure and holy,\nFriendship is too sacred far,\nFor a moment's reckless folly\nThus to desolate and mar.",
        "Angry words are lighly spoken;\nBitt'rest tho'ts are rashly stirred--\nBrightest links of life are broken,\nBy a single angry word."
    ],
    "chorus": "Love one another, Thus saith the Saviour,\nChildren, obey the Father's blest command\nLove one another, Thus saith the Saviour\nChildren, obey his blest command."
